# Learning API CRUD
This is a repo to learn to implement API CRUD operations using Javascript / Typescript

## Current features

### Product CRUD
We can create, read, update and delete products via a REST API.

### Order CRUD
We can create, read, update and delete orders via a REST API. An order is composed by products, so that means we are also validating the product <> order relationship.
